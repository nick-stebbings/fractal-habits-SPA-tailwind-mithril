                  The art of Tai Chi is said to improve the flow of Chi (Qi),
                  the traditional Chinese concept of a physically intangible
                  energy or life force. In scientific studies, Tai Chi has been
                  proven to improve a host of medical conditions including, but
                  not limited to: muscular pain, headaches, fibromyalgia,
                  cardiovascular problems, arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
                  Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Diabetes and ADHD. Though its
                  low-impact workout is especially helpful to seniors, Tai Chi
                  is for everyone and is deceptively simple in appearance.

So beyond the health benefits and stress relief, Tai Chi Chuan is also  a means to tap into one's inner self.[5]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n"

                  Small frame style. In this style (usually Wu or Hao versions)

                  involves low and high stances, more dramatic postures, and
                  swinging arms. It emphasizes correct positioning of the body
                  and alignment to channel energy.

                  There is a medium frame style, but it's really just in between
                  the two. If you have questions, ask your teacher!

                  Relax. Tensing your body is the best way to prevent getting
                  any benefit from Tai Chi. However, relax does not mean turn
                  into a wet noodle. Retain proper posture without excess
                  tension. Classic Tai Chi literature often describes this as
                  standing "as if one were suspended on a string on the top of
                  the head".

                  As a form of meditation, Tai Chi is able to help you learn to
                  understand yourself better and thereby deal with others more
                  effectively. Thus, when stressful situations arise, Tai Chi
                  learning will help you to be assertive and respectful of
                  others, as well as staying in the present and dealing with the
                  situation before you with calmness. Tai Chi helps you learn to
                  merge the opposing forces of yin and yang, self and the world
                  to achieve a natural balance for physical and spiritual
                  well-being. This balance is represented by the Tai Chi symbol.
