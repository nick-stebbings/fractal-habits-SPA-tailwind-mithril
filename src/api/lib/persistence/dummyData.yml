                    The art of Tai Chi is said to improve the flow of Chi (Qi),
                    the traditional Chinese concept of a physically intangible
                    energy or life force. In scientific studies, Tai Chi has been
                    proven to improve a host of medical conditions including, but
                    not limited to: muscular pain, headaches, fibromyalgia,
                    cardiovascular problems, arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
                    Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Diabetes and ADHD. Though its
                    low-impact workout is especially helpful to seniors, Tai Chi
                    is for everyone and is deceptively simple in appearance.

                    Relax. Tensing your body is the best way to prevent getting

                    tension. Classic Tai Chi literature often describes this as
                    standing "as if one were suspended on a string on the top of

                    As a form of meditation, Tai Chi is able to help you learn to
                    understand yourself better and thereby deal with others more
                    effectively. Thus, when stressful situations arise, Tai Chi
                    learning will help you to be assertive and respectful of
                    others, as well as staying in the present and dealing with the
                    situation before you with calmness. Tai Chi helps you learn to
                    merge the opposing forces of yin and yang, self and the world
                    to achieve a natural balance for physical and spiritual
                    well-being. This balance is represented by the Tai Chi symbol.

                    If you don’t already know how to stretch, consider learning
                    different stretching techniques to try before you meditate.
                    Many meditation experts recommend doing light yoga stretches
                    before meditation.

                    It requires practice to find the position that allows you to
                    relax your torso with only slight effort being used to
                    maintain your balance. Whenever you feel tension, relax the
                    area. If you can't relax it without slumping, check the
                    alignment of your posture and seek to rebalance your torso, so
                    those areas can relax.

                    The most important thing is that you are comfortable, relaxed,
                    and have a balanced torso, so your spine can support all of
                    your weight from the waist up.
